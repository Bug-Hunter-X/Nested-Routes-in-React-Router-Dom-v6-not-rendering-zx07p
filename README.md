This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router Dom v6.  The problem arises when a nested route is not correctly rendering within its parent route.  The solution involves understanding the proper use of the `Routes` and `Route` components within the nested structure.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.
